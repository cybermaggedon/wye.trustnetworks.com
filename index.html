<h1>Wye Streaming Framework</h1>

<ul>
<li><a href="#download">Downloads</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.github.com/cybermaggedon/wye">Github project page</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<div>
Wye is a streaming framework in early stages of development.  Written in C++,
it is very simple to get started with.  To use the framework requires writing
elements in Python, and instantiation of stream elements is possible using
Python.
</div>

<div>
Currently, the framework is limited in that:
<ul>
  <li>Framework really only usefully makes use of a single machine.</li>
  <li>Framework supports streaming components written in Python only.</li>
  <li>Framework doesn't support multi-machine, nor resilience.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
Lots of ambitions to expand the framework into:
  <ul>
    <li>Distributed stream processing, with automatic election of master.</li>
    <li>Checkpointing stream results for resilience.</li>
    <li>Stream modules written in other languages (C++, Lua, Java).</li>
    <li>Failure recovery in event of node loss.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<h2>Getting started</h2>
<div>
Compile the framework:
<pre>
autoreconf -fi
./configure
make
sudo make install
</pre>
<div>
Run the service daemon.  This starts a service on port 8080:
</div>
<pre>
# For running the examples, make sure wye-service is running in the
# examples directory.
cd .../examples/
wye-service
</pre>
<div>
  In a separate terminal, invoke a stream processing job:
  </div>
<pre>
  cd .../examples/

# Simple test, does some arithmetic.
python run_test

# When bored, delete all jobs...
wye-get-jobs | awk '(NR > 2){print $1}' | xargs -i@ wye-delete-job @

# Another simple test, uses lambdas and generators
python run_test2

# When bored, delete all jobs...
wye-get-jobs | awk '(NR > 2){print $1}' | xargs -i@ wye-delete-job @

# Calculates PI
  python run_pi
  </pre>
<div>
This submits a job consisting of a set of workers.  There is a source job
which creates a random tuple.  Two transformation elements perform
multiplication and division on the tuple.  Sinks take the elements and
output them.
</div>
<div>
The service terminal should generate lots of output, and a set of numbers once
per second.
</div>
<h2>Utilities</h2>

<pre>
wye-delete-job <job>
wye-delete-worker <worker>
wye-get-job <job>
wye-get-jobs
wye-get-worker <worker>
wye-get-workers
</pre>

<h2>JSON interface</h2>

<pre>
wget -q -O- --post-data='{
  "operation":"create-worker",
  "model":"python",
  "file":"sink.py",
  "job_id":"asd"
}' \
http://localhost:8080/
</pre>

<pre>
wget -q -O- --post-data='{
  "operation":"create-worker",
  "name": "source",
  "model":"python",
  "file":"source.py",
  "job_id":"asd",
  "outputs": {
      "o1": [ [ "one", "two" ], ["three", "four"] ]
  }
}' \
